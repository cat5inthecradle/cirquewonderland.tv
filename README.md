# Cirquewonderland.tv

## Infrastructure

I followed [this guide]() and finally got this working!

- Open Broadcaster Studio
- AWS MediaLive
- AWS MediaPackage
- AWS CloudFront
- The web page in the "live" folder of this repo

## To Do

- recreate the AWS resources to expect 720 (currently upscaling from 720 to 1080 on the recent shows)
- style the page nicer
- buy cirquewonderland.tv
- analyze the cost of streaming an event
